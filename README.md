# 代码文档更新服务 

Context7 MCP 是一款为开发者提供最新代码文档和示例的服务，通过集成到开发环境中，确保LLM生成的代码基于最新的库文档。
Context7 MCP is a service that provides developers with the latest code documentation and examples. By integrating into the development environment, it ensures that the code generated by LLMS is based on the latest library documentation.## 工具列表 Tool List

本MCP服务封装下列工具，可让模型通过标准化接口调用以下功能。 本MCP服务封装下列工具，可让模型通过标准化接口调用以下功能。

| 工具 Tool   | 描述 Description         |
|-------|--------------------|
| resolve-library-id | Resolves a package/product name to a Context7-compatible library ID and returns a list of matching libraries.  You MUST call this function before 'get-library-docs' to obtain a valid Context7-compatible library ID UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query.  Selection Process: 1. Analyze the query to understand what library/package the user is looking for 2. Return the most relevant match based on: - Name similarity to the query (exact matches prioritized) - Description relevance to the query's intent - Documentation coverage (prioritize libraries with higher Code Snippet counts) - Source reputation (consider libraries with High or Medium reputation more authoritative) - Benchmark Score: Quality indicator (100 is the highest score)  Response Format: - Return the selected library ID in a clearly marked section - Provide a brief explanation for why this library was chosen - If multiple good matches exist, acknowledge this but proceed with the most relevant one - If no good matches exist, clearly state this and suggest query refinements  For ambiguous queries, request clarification before proceeding with a best-guess match. |
| get-library-docs | Fetches up-to-date documentation for a library. You must call 'resolve-library-id' first to obtain the exact Context7-compatible library ID required to use this tool, UNLESS the user explicitly provides a library ID in the format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version' in their query. Use mode='code' (default) for API references and code examples, or mode='info' for conceptual guides, narrative information, and architectural questions. |
